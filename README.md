# Task 2 Starter Repo
Completed the Forage Wells Fargo Job Simulator to get an immersive experience in system design and implementation. 

Throughout this simulator, I gained a deeper understanding of analyzing requirements, identifying key data structures, and designing entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to visualize data relationships.
I implemented the entities from the ERD diagram with VSCode, while attempting to maintain the best practices for database driven applications.
